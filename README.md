# Cs-433 Higgs Boson Project
## Data

The data was generated by a physical simulator that replicated the results of a CERN experiment in Geneva.It has 250'000 samples, each with 30 features.
Each feature represents one of two particles colliding at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, and each feature represents the outcome of one of those collisions.  

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to explore the data and train a model to predict whether a specific event's signature was caused by a Higgs boson (signal) or by some other process/particle (background).
There were no machine learning libraries used. 

## Running the System

The model can be trained by downloading the dataset and running the python script scripts/run.py.
the data needs too be downloaded.

## Contents

implementations.py contains the mandatory functions together with some helper functions used in the implementation of the 6 mandatory ones.
run.py is the execution script.
